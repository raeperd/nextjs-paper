You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.\n- You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.\n\nA framework can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction — otherwise it won’t be very useful. It also needs to have great \"Developer Experience\", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.\n\n## Next.js: The React Framework\nEnter Next.js, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.\n\nNext.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:\n\n- An intuitive [page-based](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) routing system (with support for [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes))\n- [Pre-rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering), both [static generation (SSG)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) and [server-side rendering (SSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) are supported on a per-page basis\n- Automatic code splitting for faster page loads\n- [Client-side routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction#linking-between-pages) with optimized prefetching\n- [Built-in CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) and [Sass](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support) support, and support for any [CSS-in-JS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#css-in-js) library\n- Development environment with [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh) support\n- [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions\n- Fully extendable\n\nNext.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.\n\n- [Create a Next.js App | Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)\n"},"disqusShortname":"nextjs-paper","serverURL":"https://raeperd.github.io/nextjs-paper"},"__N_SSG":true}
