# NextJS
To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

- Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
- You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
- You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
- You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

A framework can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction — otherwise it won’t be very useful. It also needs to have great "Developer Experience", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.

## Next.js: The React Framework
Enter Next.js, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.

Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:

- An intuitive [page-based](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) routing system (with support for [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes))
- [Pre-rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering), both [static generation (SSG)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) and [server-side rendering (SSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) are supported on a per-page basis
- Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
- [Client-side routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction#linking-between-pages) with optimized prefetching
- [Built-in CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) and [Sass](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support) support, and support for any [CSS-in-JS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#css-in-js) library
- Development environment with [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh) support
- [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
- Fully extendable

Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.
